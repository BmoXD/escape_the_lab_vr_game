# 🧪 Escape the Lab (VR Game)

A small **VR escape room demo** built around a dimension-shifting puzzle mechanic.

---

## About the Project
The core gameplay revolves around traveling between two different **timelines / dimensions**.  
Both versions of the room share the same layout but with subtle differences.

The player must carefully observe these variations and use them to solve puzzles.

For example:
- An object may exist in one timeline but not the other
- Bringing that item across dimensions may lead the player closer to their goal

This mechanic is inspired by a **Portal 2** mod called **Portal Reloaded**.

## What I Practiced
- Unity's XR Toolkit
- Shader creation
- Custom XR interactable objects
- Slight Post-Processing effects
- VR game-desing
- 3D modelling
